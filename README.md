# My First Game
Added the source files for the first game I worked on in Unity. **To be clear this is not a finished game or really meant to be played. It's more just a trial run where I was learning to use certain assets in the engine. I like to share this now and then hopefully come back and see how much I improve with practice. I focused more on learning assets and scripting, along with Unity best practices. Most of my time was using TextMeshPro and creating nice menu screens, and polishing up the small amount of real features in it. There is input and an "ending" put there's no gameplay mechanics in the game so please, again, don't play the game.
